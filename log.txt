Let's see here... 
Since I did 100 calculations, you now owe me $100.
I have not been integrated with a credit card machine, Apple Pay, Google Pay, or Venmo API's yet, so I only accept cash.

Here I go...For my awesome math skills, you now owe me a penny for each count. You think programming me was cheap?
  Let's see here... 
  Since I did 47 calculations, you now owe me $0.47000000000000003.
  I have not been integrated with a credit card machine, Apple Pay, Google Pay, or Venmo API's yet, so I only accept cash.
  Sorry for the inconvenience.
